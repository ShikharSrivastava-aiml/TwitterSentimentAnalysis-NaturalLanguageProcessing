# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Repository

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks implementing various deep learning models for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. It explores a range of architectures, including BERT, CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and hybrid combinations such as BERT-CNN, BERT-LSTM, and BERT-BiLSTM. The primary goal is to predict sentiment categories—positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant—associated with Twitter entities, creating a powerful tool for gauging public opinion on different topics.

The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle. While the dataset description mentions “irrelevant” as a form of neutrality, this project treats it as a distinct class to enhance classification precision. Each notebook focuses on implementing and experimenting with a specific model to optimize sentiment classification. The BERT-CNN, BERT-BiLSTM, and BERT-LSTM notebooks demonstrate the combined strengths of BERT embeddings with CNN or RNN architectures, while BERT_final showcases the complete BERT model implementation. Testing code notebooks like BERT_MODELS_testing_code and CNN_LSTM_BiLSTM testing code offer a detailed look at model accuracy and adaptability. Finally, CNN_LSTM_BILSTM_Trainval_results summarizes training and validation outcomes for CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models.

To begin, download the dataset, open the desired notebook, and run it to explore the model architectures and perform sentiment analysis. Feel free to experiment and adjust these models as needed to improve performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores are included in each notebook, along with confusion matrices and classification reports. Our evaluation shows that BERT-based models excel in sentiment analysis, particularly when paired with CNNs and LSTMs. These hybrid models—BERT-CNN, BERT-LSTM, and BERT-BiLSTM—take advantage of BERT’s contextual capabilities and the strengths of CNNs and LSTMs, making them especially effective in Twitter sentiment classification.

To run these notebooks, ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and standard Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas installed.
